# Welcome

The Made Smarter Innovation Research Centre for Smart, Collaborative Industrial Robotics, also known as the Smart Cobotics Centre, is a collaboration between six leading UK universities: Loughborough University (lead), University of Bristol, Cranfield University, University of Dundee, University of Strathclyde and University of Warwick, having research experience in manufacturing, engineering, digital technology, robotics, human-factors, verification and safety, law, psychology, systems engineering, metrology and ICT.

The Centre is built on strong relationships with a wide cross section of 40+ industrial and research partners across core UK industrial sectors including aerospace, automotive, agri-food, green energy, construction and space, both nationally and internationally.

Future smart manufacturing systems will drive productivity through smart, multi “actor” collaboration solving complex tasks. Large enterprises will benefit from this, as automation can be brought into traditionally manual production processes. Similarly, better accessibility and agility will allow more small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) to benefit from automation, therefore improving their competitiveness.

# Mission
The mission of the Centre is to unlock the full potential of UK industry to improve productivity and maximise growth by enabling people to achieve high quality results through collaborative automation and robotics.
